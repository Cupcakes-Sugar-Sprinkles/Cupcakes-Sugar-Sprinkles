Hey so I managed to get the pictures onto the back and figure out where the headings go. If we really can't figureout the rest we can just change the text and links can call it a day!

Things I think still need to be done:

ESSENTIALS-
find out how to get this online!!!
Font changes
change the content
Test if it works on the mobile version!


OTHERS-
fix the images (they're squished)
figure out how to add headings and footers
add search bar
add our profiles if we can manage this!



Our other ideas are still on the sheet we made notes on (I posted a pic of it into the whatsapp convo).

Sorry I wont have PC access until late sunday night/ Monday so I won't be able to contribute more until then!

Good luck, and I'll have a look the moment I get back

Amy
